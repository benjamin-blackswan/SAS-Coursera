**1. How many steps does this program contain?**

```
data national;
    set sashelp.baseball;
    BatAvg=nHits/nAtBat;
run;

proc contents data=national;
run;

proc print data=national;
run;

proc means data=national;
    var BatAvg;
run;
```
Answer: 4 There is one DATA step and three PROC steps for a total of four steps. RUN, QUIT, DATA, and PROC statements function as step boundaries, which determine when SAS statements take effect and indicate the end of the current step or the beginning of a new step.
