**1v1. How many steps does this program contain?**

```
data national;
    set sashelp.baseball;
    BatAvg=nHits/nAtBat;
run;

proc contents data=national;
run;

proc print data=national;
run;

proc means data=national;
    var BatAvg;
run;
```
_Answer: 4_

_There is one DATA step and three PROC steps for a total of four steps. RUN, QUIT, DATA, and PROC statements function as step boundaries, which determine when SAS statements take effect and indicate the end of the current step or the beginning of a new step._

**1v2. Steps begin with a ____ or ____ statement and end with a ____ or ____ statement.**

_Answer: DATA or PROC; RUN or QUIT_

_Steps must begin with a DATA or PROC statement and typically end with either a RUN or QUIT statement. These statements create the boundaries of the step and what is to be completed within that step. If a RUN or QUIT statement is not used at the end of a step, the beginning of a new step implies the end of the previous step._

**2v1. Running a SAS program will always produce which of the following?**

_Answer:log_

_A log will always be generated regardless of the contents of the program._


**2v2. Running a SAS program can create which of the following? Select all that apply.**

_Answer: lgo, output data, results_



**2v3. If results are generated after a program is run, the program ran successfully and you do not need to review the log.**

_Answer: False_

_Results can still be created with errors in the program. Running a SAS program in SAS Studio will always generate a log regardless of whether or not there are errors included in the log. It is best practice to always review the log._

**3v1. Which of the following statements about SAS syntax requirements is incorrect?**

* All statements end in a semicolon.
* Spacing is not a requirement in a SAS program.
* Unquoted values are not case sensitive.
* Global statements must be inside DATA or PROC steps

Answer: Not(All statement)
        Not(unquoted values are not case sensitive)
Unquoted values can be uppercase, lowercase and mixed case. It will not create an error in your code. Review SAS Program Syntax.
All statements end in a semicolon to announce the end of the statement. Statements can be multiple lines long, but must end in a semicolon. 

**3v2. Which of the following statements is true regarding SAS syntax? Select all that apply.**

_Answer: statements end with a semicolon, quoted values are case sensitive, global statements can be outside steps_.

**4v1. Which of the following steps is typically used to generate reports and graphs?**

Answer: PROC steps are typically used to process SAS data sets (that is, generate reports, graphs, and statistics).

**4v2. The DATA step typically performs which functions? Select all that apply.**

Answer: create data, read data, process data

**5v1. When can you use an asterisk and a semicolon to comment out code?**

_Answer: When it is a single statement_

_To comment out a single statement of code, you just add an asterisk at the beginning as there should already be a semicolon at the end. This statement will not be included with the rest of the code when running the program._




**5v2. Does this comment contain syntax errors?**
```
*Report created for cost
presentation; revised November 9;

proc print data=work.newloan;
run;
```

Answer: Not (yes, comments cannot be more than one line)

**5v3. Does this comment contain syntax errors?**

```
/*
Report created for budget
presentation; revised October 15.
 */

proc print data=work.newloan;
run;
```
_Answer: No. The comment is correctly specified._

_A block comment can contain semicolons and unbalanced quotation marks, can appear anywhere, and doesn’t need a semicolon at the end._

**6v1. What result would you expect from submitting this step?**
```
proc print data=work.newsalesemps
run;
```

_Answer: an error message in the log_

_There is a missing semicolon following the data set name. When this step runs, SAS interprets the word run as an option in the PROC PRINT statement (because of the missing semicolon). As a result, the PROC PRINT step will not execute and an error message will be displayed in the log._


**6v2. Submitting this step would create an error message in the log. **
```
proc print data=work.newsalesemps;
run;
```

_Answer: No because it is a correctly formatted step_
_The step would not produce an error in the log because it is correctly formatted following all SAS syntax requirements. It begins with either a DATA or PROC statement, semicolons are used at the end of each statement and the step ends with a RUN statement._

**7v1. SAS will not execute the following step because PROC is misspelled.**
```
porc print data=work.newsalesemps;
run;
```
_Answer: False_


**7v2. What happens if you submit the following program?**
```
daat mygolfcarts;
    set sashelp.golfcarts;
    AvgMPG=mean(mpg_pavement, mpg_offroad);
run;
```

_Answer: SAS assumes that DATA is misspelled and executes the step._

_SAS will assume that the keyword was misspelled, correct it temporarily, and execute the DATA step. There will be a warning or an error message in your log directing you to correct your code._

**8v1. This program contains a syntax error because BatAvg is in different cases.**
```
data Seasonal;
    set sashelp.baseball;
    BatAvg=nHits/nAtBat;
run;

proc means data=Seasonal;
    var BATAVG;
```
run;

_Answer: False_

_Case is irrelevant unless it is quoted values, therefore in this scenario, the column name can be specified in uppercase, lowercase, and mixed case._


**8v2. This program contains a syntax error because National is in different cases.**
```
data national;
    set sashelp.baseball;
    BatAvg=nHits/nAtBat;
run;

proc means data=NATIONAL;
    var BatAvg;
run;
```

_Answer: False_

_Case does not matter in unquoted values, so in this case, the data set name can be specified in any case._

**8v3. Quoted values are case sensitive.**

_Answer: True_

_SAS is only case sensitive to quoted values. All unquoted values are not case sensitive and can include uppercase, lowercase, and mixed case._

**9v1. How many statements does this program contain?**

```
title "American Cars Priced Over 50K";
footnote "Internal Use Only";

proc print data=sashelp.cars;
    where Origin=‘USA’
    and MSRP>50000;
    var Make Model Type
    Mpg_City Mpg_Highway;
run;
```

_Answer: 6_

_This program contains six statements (six semicolons). Each of the following is considered a statement: TITLE, FOOTNOTE, PROC, WHERE (spans two lines), VAR (spans two lines), and RUN._


**9v2. How many statements does the following PROC step contain?**
```
title "European Cars Priced Over 25K";
footnote "Internal Use Only";

proc print data=sashelp.cars;
    where Origin='Europe'
    and MSRP>25000;
    var Make Model Type
    Mpg_City Mpg_Highway;
run;
```

_Answer: not(5, 6)_

_Steps always begin with a DATA or PROC statement and end with a RUN or QUIT statement. Not all statements are within steps. Statements usually begin with a keyword and always end with a semicolon. They can span multiple lines and spacing formatting is not required. Review SAS Program Structure._

**9v3. How many statements does this program contain?**

```
*Create a cars report;

title "European Cars Priced Over 30K";
footnote "Internal Use Only";

proc print data=sashelp.cars;
    where Origin='Europe'
    and MSRP>30000;
    var Make Model Type
    Mpg_City Mpg_Highway;
run;
```
_Answer: seven_
_This program contains seven statements (seven semicolons): comment, TITLE, FOOTNOTE, PROC, WHERE (two lines), VAR (two lines), and RUN._
